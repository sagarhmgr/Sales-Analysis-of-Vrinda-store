Vrinda Store Annual Report 2022

This project focused on analyzing the sales and customer data of Vrinda Store to uncover meaningful insights that can guide business decisions. 
The process began with cleaning and preparing the Excel dataset by handling missing values, ensuring consistent formatting, and structuring the data for efficient analysis. 
Once the dataset was ready, exploratory analysis was carried out using pivot tables, charts, and statistical summaries to identify sales patterns, customer segments, and seasonal trends. 
The analysis also involved comparing performance across different product categories, regions, and time periods to evaluate growth opportunities and highlight underperforming areas.
Visualizations were created to simplify the interpretation of complex data, making it easier to communicate findings. 
The project concludes with recommendations designed to improve customer targeting, optimize inventory, and strengthen overall business performance. 
By transforming raw sales data into actionable insights, this project provides Vrinda Store with a stronger foundation for data-driven decision-making.
